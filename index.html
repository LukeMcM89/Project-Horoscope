                                <h4 class="subtile">A horoscope is an astrological chart, also commonly referred to as a
                                    natal chart or cosmogram that represents the
                                    position of the Sun, Moon, planets, astrological aspects and sensitive angles at the
                                    time of an event. An important moment for many
                                    being the moment of an individuals birth. An astrological chart or Horoscope,
                                    therefor is a
                                    schematic representation of the heavens at any given moment of time. <br><br>
                                    The word <em>Horoscope</em> is derived from the Greek words <em>ora</em> and
                                    <em>scope</em> meaning "time" and "observer of the hour".
                                    Essentially, the horoscope serves as a stylized map of the heavens over a specific
                                    location at a particular moment in time. The positions
                                    of the planets, including the Sun and Moon are placed in the chart, along with other
                                    calculated factors, such as the lunar nodes, the
                                    house cusps, the zodiac signs and fixed stars. The angular relationships between the
                                    planets themselves and other points, called aspects
                                    are then determined. It is important to note that the emphasis and interpretation of
                                    these factors vary significantly with tradition.
                                    Therefore, it is believed within certain spiritiual communities or systems of
                                    belief, that in essence, the stars situated at the time
                                    of birth of an individual, accurately reflect that individuals characterstics,
                                    personality, proclivites, mannerisms, strength and weaknesses. <br><br>
                                    Angles <br>
                                    There are four primary angles or Cardinal points of an astrological chart. These are
                                    listed in order of power or influence:
                                    <li>First House (Ascendant - East Angle)</li>
                                    <li>Tenth House (Midheaven, or Medium Coeli (M.C.) - North Angle)</li>
                                    <li>Seventh House (Descendant - West Angle)</li>
                                    <li>Fourth House (Imum Coeli or I.C. - South Angle)</li> <br>
                                    The Zodiac <br>
                                    The Zodiac, also known as the "circle of animals" is a zone or belt in space that
                                    extends approximately 8 degrees North or South
                                    of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the
                                    course of the year. In Western astrology,
                                    and formerly astronomy, the zodiac is divided into 12 signs. These signs from a
                                    celestial coordinate system. It was referenced and studied by
                                    civilizations as far back in history as the Babylonians and was also in
                                    use during the Roman era.
