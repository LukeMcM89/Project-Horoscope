                <h2>A Brief History of Horoscopes</h2>
                <p class="horo-text">A horoscope is an astrological chart, also commonly referred to as a natal chart or
                    cosmogram, that represents the
                    position of the Sun, Moon, planets, astrological aspects and sensitive angels at the time of an
                    event. An important moment for many
                    being the moment of a persons birth.</p> <br>
                <p class="horo-text">The word <em>horoscope</em> is derived from the Greek words <em>ora</em> and
                    <em>scopos</em> meaning "time" and "observer
                    of the hour". Essentially, the horoscope serves as a stylized map of the heavens over a specific
                    location at a particular moment in time.
                    The positions of the planets, including the Sun and Moon are placed in the chart, along with other
                    calculated factor such as the lunar nodes,
                    the house cusps, the zodiac signs and fixed stars. The angular relationships between the planets
                    themselves and other points, called aspects
                    are then determined. It is important to note that the emphasis and interpretation of these factors
                    vary with tradition. So in essence, the stars
                    were placed at the time of birth for a person shows their characteristics and personality, including
                    weakness.</p>
